\section{CP model}


\subsection{Decision variables}

The CP model is inspired by the model presented in \cite{vrp} and relies on the following decision variables:
\begin{itemize}
    \item For each package $p$, $A_p \in \{ 1, \dots, m \}$ (\texttt{assignments[p]} in MiniZinc) indicates which courier delivers it. More specifically, $A_p = c$ iff the package $p$ is delivered by the courier $c$.
    
    \item For each courier $c$, $P_{c, d} \in \{ 1, \dots, n+1 \}$ for $d \in \{ 1, \dots, n+1 \}$ (\texttt{path[c, d]} in MiniZinc) models the path taken by the courier $c$. The path is defined such that $P_{c, d_1} = d_1$ iff the location $d_1$ is not part of the route of $c$ and $P_{c, d_1} = d_2$ iff $d_2$ is visited immediately after $d_1$ in the route of $c$. In other words, each relevant location indicates which is its successor and the overall route is defined as a Hamiltonian cycle that starts from $n+1$ (i.e., the depot).
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Objective function}
Once the route of each courier has been found, the objective function is computed as follows:
\begin{equation}
    \max_{c \in \{ 1, \dots, m \}} \sum_{\substack{d \in \{1, \dots, n+1\}:\\P_{c, d} \neq d}} \texttt{D[$d$, $P_{c, d}$]} 
\end{equation}
The lower-bound of this function corresponds to the longest route that involves a single item and can be computed as follows:
\begin{equation}
    \max_{p \in \{ 1, \dots, n \}} \left\{ \texttt{D[$n+1$, $p$]} + \texttt{D[$p$, $n+1$]} \right\}
\end{equation}


\subsection{Constraints}

To respect the capacity limits of each courier, the following constraint can be defined:
\begin{equation}
    \forall c \in \{ 1, \dots, m \}: \sum_{p \in \{1, \dots, n\}: A_p = c} s_p \leq l_c 
\end{equation}
In MiniZinc, the global constraint \texttt{bin\_packing\_capa} also models this. In our experiments, we did not notice significant differences between the two formulations and decided to use the latter following the best practice of preferring global constraints.

To model the route, the following constraints have to be imposed:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:cp_constr_route_depot}
    \forall c \in \{ 1, \dots, m \}: 
    \begin{cases}
        P_{c, n+1} = n+1    & \text{if $\nexists p \in \{ 1, \dots, n \}: A_p = c$} \\ 
        P_{c, n+1} \neq n+1 & \text{if $\exists p \in \{ 1, \dots, n \}: A_p = c$} 
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:cp_constr_route_packs}
    \forall c \in \{ 1, \dots, m \},
    \forall p \in \{ 1, \dots, n \}: 
    \begin{cases}
        P_{c, p} = p    & \text{if $A_p \neq c$} \\
        P_{c, p} \neq p & \text{if $A_p = c$} 
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

The constraint defined in \Cref{eq:cp_constr_route_depot} imposes that, for each courier, the depot has a successor only if that courier delivers at least a package. On the same note, \Cref{eq:cp_constr_route_packs} imposes that only the packages delivered by a specific courier have a successor in the route.
Moreover, it is necessary to impose that the route defined by $P_c$ is a Hamiltonian cycle that passes through the relevant destinations. This can be done by constraining all the elements of $P_c$ to be different and by defining a subtour elimination constraint (e.g., Miller-Tucker-Zemlin \cite{mtz_subtour}). In MiniZinc, this can be easily modelled by using the global constraint \texttt{subcircuit}.


\subsubsection{Symmetry breaking constraints}

The most notable symmetry in this problem is between couriers with the same capacity. In fact, as the assignments between two couriers with the same capacity are interchangeable, it is reasonable to fix an ordering and avoid redundancies during search. We experimented with two approaches: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item By imposing an ordering on the amount of assigned packages:
        \begin{equation}
            \label{eq:cp_symm_amount}
            \forall c_1, c_2 \in \{ 1, \dots, m \}: (c_1 < c_2 \land l_{c_1} = l_{c_2}) \Rightarrow Q_{c_1} \leq Q_{c_2}
        \end{equation}
        where $Q_c$ is the amount of packages delivered by the courier $c$.
    \item By imposing an ordering on indexes of the assigned packages:
        \begin{equation}
            \label{eq:cp_symm_packs}
            \forall c_1, c_2 \in \{ 1, \dots, m \}: (c_1 < c_2 \land l_{c_1} = l_{c_2}) \Rightarrow A_{c_1} <_\texttt{lex} A_{c_2}
        \end{equation}
        where $A_c$ is a vector containing the packages delivered by the courier $c$.
        % (in practice, it is a vector of $n$ elements where the $i$-th position is 0 if the package $i$ is not in the route and $i$ if it is. An alternative formulation for MiniZinc uses a list comprehension and the \texttt{deopt} operator, but we observed that this slows down the model).
\end{itemize}

Moreover, we experimented with a stronger version of these constraints that is applied between two couriers that satisfy the following condition:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:cp_symm_strong}
    \max\left\{ L_{c_1}, L_{c_2} \right\} \leq \min\left\{ l_{c_1}, l_{c_2} \right\}
\end{equation}
where $L_c$ is the actual load carried by the courier $c$.



\subsection{Validation}

\subsubsection{Experimental design}

We experimented variations of our models using as solvers Gecode, Chuffed, and OR-Tools. The search order for all models assigns the packages (\texttt{assignments}) first and then searches for the route (\texttt{path}) of each courier in decreasing order of capacity. Regarding search, we experimented several combinations of variable selection and assignment strategies on a subset of instances and used only the best ones to obtain the final complete results.

All experiments use the same random seed and were run as workflows on GitHub Actions which provides two cores at 2.45 GHz and 7 GB of memory, which we software limited to 5 GB to guarantee a safe margin for the Docker container to run.


\subsubsection{Experimental results}

From some preliminary experiments, we observed that first fail and largest domain with weighted degree (\texttt{dom\_w\_deg}) are the best performing search strategies. Therefore, we performed the full experiments using as search strategy \texttt{dow\_w\_deg} for \texttt{assignments} and \texttt{first\_fail} for \texttt{path}, respectively. Moreover, between the two symmetry breaking constraints, we observed that the lexicographic ordering defined in \Cref{eq:cp_symm_packs} has better performances and therefore present only those results. The objective values found by the most significant models are reported in \Cref{tab:cp_results}.

For Gecode, we experimented different search approaches by testing restart methods, large neighborhood search (LNS), and varying symmetry breaking constraints. We observed that, compared to a depth-first approach, by simply restarting search following the Luby sequence there is a mixed impact on the results with both positive and negative effects. Instead, by also using LNS, results tend to improve globally and we observed that a higher retain probability, with a peak at around $95\%$, works better. Regarding symmetry breaking constraints, we observed that they tend to worsen the final objective value in the majority of the cases, most reasonably due to the fact that the overhead to impose them is higher than the speed-up in search. For a visual comparison, we show in \Cref{fig:cp_obj_plots} the evolution of the objective value during search. It can be seen that without restart the objective stops improving in the early stages of search as it most likely gets ``stuck" in a branch of the search tree. By introducing some non-determinism, the objective reaches lower values, with LNS being the fastest and best performing.

For Chuffed, we only experimented with restarts and symmetry breaking constraints as LNS is not available through MiniZinc. Moreover, as indicated in the documentation\footnote{\url{https://docs.minizinc.dev/en/stable/solvers.html}}, we tried enabling free search mode but only obtained worse results. Compared to Gecode, results on bigger instances are generally all worse, while smaller instances tend to be solved faster by Chuffed. As in Gecode, restarts, which we only experimented with random variable selection as it is the only non-deterministic search strategy available, and symmetry breaking constraints both yield mixed effects on the final result.

Finally, for OR-Tools, we conducted fewer experiments as it supports fewer MiniZinc annotations. In this case, we observed that enabling free search mode allows obtaining better results and, similarly to Gecode and Chuffed, symmetry breaking constraints have mixed results. As a side note, we must also observe that, as suggested in the documentation, these results are worse as OR-Tools performs better with multi-threading.
